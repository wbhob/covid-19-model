# COVID-19 Social Distancing Model

This model is built using Processing. Please download the latest version and run `covid_19_model.pde`.

## Customization

I've made some variables you can experiment with to see how they affect the spread of the disease. Here's what each variable represents:

`infectionChance` - the chance out of 100 that contact with an infected blob will lead to infection

`recoveryChance` - the chance out of 100 that an infected blob will not die after the disease runs its course

`isolationChance` - the chance that a blob will be isolated. in other words, the percentage of blobs that are practicing social distancing.

`sicknessLength` - the duration, in frames, that the blob has the illness.

`blobCount` - the number of blobs in the model region. Can be used to adjust the density.
